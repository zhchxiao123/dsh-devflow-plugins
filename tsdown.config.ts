/**
 * Host-half build: one ESM entry pair per package (`lib/index.js` and the
 * `lib/invariant.js` companion), which is what `main`/`exports` point at and
 * therefore what a consumer actually loads. `tsc -b` emits declarations into
 * `lib/types/`; it does not emit the runtime entries, so publishing without
 * this step ships manifests pointing at files that do not exist.
 *
 * Everything outside the package is external: harness packages arrive from the
 * consumer's own node_modules at the version their profile installed, and
 * bundling a copy of one would give a deployment two module identities for a
 * service that must be a singleton.
 *
 * The browser half of `devflow-ui` is NOT built here — it needs the harness's
 * client-bundle preset (a loader-factory artifact), which is its own slice.
