# Devflow task cards

English | [中文](devflow.zh.md)

Types shared by the file-backed task-card seam and its consumers. The [devflow Agent Note](../../.agents/notes/implemented/feature/2026-08-25-devflow-file-based-task-cards.md) owns the seam decisions; this page records the exact fields and variants from [`packages/devflow/src/types.ts`](../../packages/devflow/src/types.ts).

## Identity and stages

`DevflowCardId` is a [branded id](core.md#branded-ids) equal to the card's directory name (`<seq>-<slug>`), stable from creation. `DevStage` is the closed pipeline union; `blocked` is a bypass location, not a stage, and a blocked card remembers the stage it interrupted.

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * The closed set of pipeline stages a card moves through. `blocked` is not a
 * stage: it is a bypass location that remembers the stage it interrupted (see
 * {@link CardLocation}).
 */
type DevStage =
  | 'draft'
  | 'designing'
  | 'ready'
  | 'developing'
  | 'reviewing'
  | 'testing'
  | 'done'
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Where a card currently sits: a pipeline stage, or the `blocked` bypass. */
type CardLocation = DevStage | 'blocked'
```

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * The closed set of service classes a card is created under, each selecting
 * which edges of the pipeline that card may take. Every class is a superset of
 * `standard`, so a class only ever adds a shortcut.
 */
type ServiceClass = 'standard' | 'express' | 'emergency'
```

A card is created under one of three closed **service classes**, fixed at creation and never changed, which selects the edges it may take. `standard` is the default and walks the whole pipeline. `express` reaches `developing` from `draft` and `done` from `reviewing`, skipping design, readiness, and independent verification while keeping peer review. `emergency` reaches `developing` from `draft` and `done` from `developing`, giving up review as well; its follow-up is an ordinary card rather than an obligation in the state machine. Every class is a superset of `standard` — a class adds shortcuts and removes nothing — and a stage a class skips is not a bypassed gate, because the card never traverses that edge. The shortcuts are ordinary `from->to` keys, so a deployment may gate them like any other edge. The vocabulary is closed for the same reason the stage list is; [the service-class Agent Note](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-08-31-devflow-service-class.md) owns the decision.

Moves follow the pipeline order, plus the rework edges that send a card back to the stage owning the fault: `reviewing` and `testing` both reach `developing` and `designing`, and `developing` reaches `designing` — because implementing a design is the most common way to discover it is wrong, and the alternative was routing the card through a review that never happened. Every rework edge requires a recorded `reason`. Any non-terminal location may enter `blocked`, which recovers only to the exact stage it interrupted; nothing leaves `done`.

A card that will never be finished is **abandoned** rather than parked: any location except `done` accepts it, the reason is required because it is all that survives the card, and the card leaves the board for the archive instead of occupying a column nobody is working in. Abandoning is terminal — no journal entry may follow it, so an abandoned card is the one archived card that cannot be restored — and it is a human decision, so it lives on the human surfaces — `/devflow` and the board — and has no model-facing tool. It stays readable in the archive, reason and all. [The abandonment Agent Note](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-08-31-devflow-reasoned-abandonment.md) owns the decision.

Two of those names are read wrongly often enough to state plainly. `testing` is independent verification and acceptance, not the stage in which tests are first written — this line's own gate is per-file 100% coverage with the tests in the same change as the implementation, so a card arriving at `testing` with its tests unwritten already failed `developing`. `done` means the change is proven good in the repository; it does not mean a user received it. Deployment, release, and outcome measurement sit outside this model, so a column full of `done` cards is not evidence of delivered value.

## Journal entries

The append-only journal is the authoritative card history; the card file's frontmatter is a rebuildable projection. `decodeJournalEntry` validates each parsed line at the durable boundary, and `foldJournal` enforces contiguous revisions from 1, `created` first and only first, transitions departing the current location, exact blocked recovery, nothing following an `abandoned` entry, archiving only a `done` card, and nothing but a `restored` entry following an `archived` one.

Archiving is a journal event like any other state change, so a filed card carries an `archived` entry and a card brought back carries a `restored` one. Both are human decisions, made on `/devflow` or on the board; the directory move under `archive/<YYYY-MM>/` follows the append and is cleanup, so `list` decides what is active from folded state rather than from where a directory sits. Restoring returns visibility, not progress — a restored `done` card is still done. [The archive-lifecycle Agent Note](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-09-devflow-archive-lifecycle.md) owns the decision.

A requirement too big for one card becomes a parent card plus one child card per slice. The edge is the `created` entry's `parent`, fixed at creation and never re-pointed; it folds into `DevCard.parent`, projects as the frontmatter `parent:`, and narrows reads through `CardFilter.parent`. The breakdown is one level deep and never crosses roots — the provider enforces both when a child is created (`unknown-parent`, `nested-parent`, `parent-settled`).

/** Who performed a journal action; `command` marks the human-command intervention plane. */

Both card reads narrow by one predicate vocabulary; they differ in pagination, not in how a card is selected. `list` returns the whole active set — six of its seven consumers depend on that, one of them a gate — while `query` pages and is the only way to reach the archive, whose size cannot be promised.

  set?: CardSet

   * error rather than an empty result.

  limit?: number
  /**

   */
  cursor?: string
}
```

```ts type-equiv

## Service behavior

The abstract [`DevflowStore`](../../packages/devflow/src/index.ts) Service Definition specifies journal-authoritative `list`/`read`, explicit create/transition requests, the transition waterfall, and exclusive claim leases. [`FilesystemDevflowStore`](../../packages/devflow-filesystem/src/index.ts) is the file Service Provider; [`dsh-tool-devflow`](../../packages/devflow-tool/README.md) is the model-facing Consumer through which the Harness agent creates, inspects, attaches artifacts to, and advances cards. [`dsh-devflow-fs-guard`](../../packages/devflow-fs-guard/README.md) keeps the store as the only write path over protected card state. Four policies compose on the transition waterfall: [`dsh-devflow-artifact-gate`](../../packages/devflow-artifact-gate/README.md) checks registered artifacts mechanically and publishes proactive requirements; [`dsh-devflow-agent-gate`](../../packages/devflow-agent-gate/README.md) runs independent LLM admission checks; [`dsh-devflow-gates`](../../packages/devflow-gates/README.md) runs commands and one-shot approvals; and [`dsh-devflow-parent-gate`](../../packages/devflow-parent-gate/README.md) prevents a decomposed requirement from finishing before its children. [`dsh-command-devflow`](../../packages/devflow-command/README.md) is the deterministic human intervention plane. [`dsh-devflow-web`](../../packages/devflow-web/README.md) and [`dsh-client-ui-devflow`](../../packages/devflow-ui/README.md) expose the browser channel and board: reads of the active set and the archive, plus the decisions a person makes about a card's place on the board — filing a finished card, sweeping the finished ones, dropping one that will not be built. Executing verbs are not on that channel, and restoring stays on the command plane. There is deliberately no second background executor: execution and progression belong to the Harness agent, while plugins own state, tools, policy, commands, and views.

## The artifact contract

A deployment that wants artifact discipline composes the four transition policies while the Harness agent remains the executor — no policy hardcodes a contract, so the whole thing is configuration. The sample below is the devflow half of a profile (the harness's shell executor, subagent runtime, and default-model rows are composed as usual), and every pipeline edge carries a contract; [`tests/artifact-contract-composition.spec.ts`](../../tests/artifact-contract-composition.spec.ts) boots this composition shape through the real Loader and drives one card draft→done across it.

**Load order is the waterfall.** Listeners on `devflow/transition` run in registration order, so the mount order of the four policies is the decision order, and the sample's order is deliberate: **mechanical → agent → command → approval/completion**, cheapest and most deterministic first. The free structure check vetoes before a checker spends model budget on an incomplete deliverable; the checker vetoes before a command gate spends a test suite's wall-clock on unsound work; and commands run before a human is asked. A deployment that configures an approval at all buys the same ordering: the human is asked only once every automatic layer has said yes. The [bundle](../../packages/devflow-bundle/README.md) mounts its policy rows in exactly this order, and the composition test asserts it holds — a mechanical defect dispatches zero checkers and runs zero gate commands.

**Kinds are defined and judged at one point.** The `kinds` section of `devflow-artifact-gate` is the only place a kind's structure exists; it is published as the read-only [`devflowArtifactStructures`](#ctxdevflowartifactspecs--artifactspecs-value-service) service, while [`devflowArtifactContract`](#ctxdevflowartifactcontract--artifactcontract-value-service) exposes the gate's exact outgoing-edge judgment before a move. Everything else consumes that vocabulary without restating its shape: the agent gate's `inputs` select which registrations feed a check, and model tools render the dynamic inspection returned by the contract service — so preflight cannot drift from enforcement.

# approval only to an edge whose blast radius warrants stopping all of them,

- name: '@zhchxiao123/dsh-devflow-parent-gate'

# The Harness agent is the producer and executor. It reads each tool result's
# artifactGates preflight, registers the required kind through
# devflow_attach_artifact, and advances the card explicitly.
```

The rework loop needs no second orchestrator: a veto leaves the card in place with the reason (an agent veto's full report lands under the card's `.devflow/reports/agent-gate/`), the Harness agent registers a fixed revision of the same kind, and the retry re-checks against that newest registration — the agent gate re-dispatches because the changed input revision misses its verdict cache, while a retry with nothing changed reuses the cached verdict instead of paying a second checker.

### Rich-content artifacts: pointer plus a separate file

The five kinds above are all plain Markdown, and `sections` only checks that a heading exists — it does not care about the semantics of what sits under it. A deliverable like a test report wants richer content — screenshots, progress bars — that Markdown cannot express well, without either bloating the journal with a large file or hitting the model's single-turn output cap. No new mechanism is needed: the existing `nonEmptySections` structure check plus the existing two `attachArtifact` registration forms (kind+content and path-only) already compose into an answer. Here is a kind definition a deployment that wants this capability can adopt directly:

```yaml
test-report-html:
  frontmatter: [card]
  nonEmptySections: [Report]
edges:
  'testing->done': [test-report-html]
```

Use `nonEmptySections` rather than `sections`: `sections`, which only requires a heading to exist, would pass an empty section — equivalent to passing a "pointer" that points at nothing. `nonEmptySections` additionally requires at least one non-blank line between a heading and the next, forcing the pointer text to actually say something (even if it is just a relative path). A registered pointer's content looks like:

```md
---
card: 0001-my-card
---

## Report

HTML report: artifacts/report.html
```

Landing this deliverable follows the **"Bash writes, double registration"** pattern — one landing in three steps:

1. **Bash writes the file.** The step that produces the report uses Bash (not the Write/Edit tool) to write `report.html` and any screenshots into `<card directory>/artifacts/`. `devflow-fs-guard` intercepts any tool's write/edit intent under the `.devflow` subtree by matching a path segment name, down to the `artifacts/` subdirectory, with no exception — the model's Write/Edit tools cannot create `report.html` directly under a card directory. The guard's own module doc states it is a "policy fence over the tool plane, not a kernel boundary," and a Bash write is not intercepted by it; that is exactly the opening this pattern uses.
2. **A path-only registration.** `attachArtifact({ path: 'artifacts/report.html', ... })`, carrying no `kind`. This registration takes no part in the gate's judgment (the gate only recognizes registrations with `kind === 'test-report-html'`) — its job is the board's "open" visibility: `devflow-ui` opens the real file on disk by the registered `path`, treating a record the same whether or not it carries a `kind`.
3. **A kind+content registration.** `attachArtifact({ kind: 'test-report-html', content: <pointer text>, ... })`, where `content` is a short passage that satisfies the kind's structure above and names the relative path `artifacts/report.html` in its body. This registration's job is satisfying the structural gate on `testing->done`; `content` is only a pointer, not the report itself — stuffing the whole `report.html` into `content` would reintroduce the very two problems this pattern exists to avoid: a large file in the journal, and the model's single-turn output cap.

The order of the two registrations does not matter, but both are required: with only the path-only registration, `testing->done` is still rejected ("test-report-html: no artifact of this kind is registered"); with only the kind+content registration, the gate passes, but the board loses the clickable row pointing at the real `report.html` — opening it shows the pointer text itself, not the report. This pattern is shown only on the `testing->done` edge as an example; the edges for `prd`/`design`/`implement`/`review` do not need it and stay plain Markdown.

## Architecture documents

Knowledge that outlives a card lives behind a second seam, [`ctx.devflowSpec`](../packages/devflow-spec/README.md), not in the card journal. Documents sit under `.devflow/spec/<id>.md` as frontmatter plus body, and every substantive claim rests on a declared **anchor** the store evaluates on every read: `symbol` (the name must still be declared), `content-hash` (the symbol's parser-normalized body must still hash the same), or `churn` (the file must not have been committed after the document). A verdict is three-valued — `fresh`, `stale`, `unevaluable` — and the third is never folded into the first, because a check that can no longer run has not passed.

Every anchor must resolve `fresh` at write time, so a `stale` verdict later always means the code moved rather than that the document was wrong from the start. A `content-hash` anchor written without a digest takes the anchored symbol's current one: no caller outside this line can compute a digest over a normalized body, and requiring one would leave the strongest anchor kind unreachable from the model plane.

The root sits inside `.devflow/`, which [`dsh-devflow-fs-guard`](../packages/devflow-fs-guard/README.md) already denies file tools, so [`dsh-devflow-spec-tool`](../packages/devflow-spec-tool/README.md) is the only write path by enforcement rather than by intent. Spec state stays out of the journal on purpose: a document's authority is the file plus git, so mounting or removing this seam never changes how a committed card replays. The decisions are owned by [the anchor-model Agent Note](../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-02-devflow-spec-anchor-model.md).

### Reacting to drift

The default reaction to drift is session-hosted, not edge-hosted. [`dsh-devflow-spec-sentinel`](../packages/devflow-spec-sentinel/README.md) watches which files each turn's first-party `write`/`edit` calls landed; when a stopping turn has left an anchored document stale, it forces one continuation step naming the document, the failing anchors, and the four legitimate exits — rewrite via `replaces`, replace a document that was wrong, retire the claim through a merge, or explicitly defer. The same document never interrupts the same session twice, and there is no retry ceiling: a stale document is a reference whose reader owes it one informed look, not an obligation to fight over, so a mid-refactor rename that keeps a document stale for many turns is a legitimate state, and the sentinel's own message says so. `churn` anchors never trigger it — an uncommitted edit cannot flip one, so churn health belongs to the census below.

After that one interruption — or a defer — staleness stays visible rather than forceful. The `devflow-spec-map` runtime context lists, before each model step, the documents relevant to what the session has touched, as index lines only. Two layers: documents whose anchors claim files the session's writes landed, stale ones first with their failing anchors named; and the other documents of every package the session has touched at all, reads included, because reading a file is the early "about to work here" signal. The index is byte-capped and diffed by the harness; a body still reaches the model only through `devflow_read_spec`, warning line attached. Zero configuration is meaningful: without the seam the sentinel and the index are inert, and mounting them enforces nothing a deployment did not already write down as anchors.

### Reaching a card

The declarations below are the **opt-in paper record**: a card-level contract a deployment configures deliberately, on top of the automatic path above, which needs none of it.

A card says which documents its work touches through a `spec-refs` artifact — a `## Scope` section listing id prefixes. Make it a required kind on `draft->designing` and a card cannot leave draft without answering — on the standard route only: `express` and `emergency` enter work through `draft->developing` and never cross that edge, so this contract as written binds none of their cards. A deployment adopting it either accepts standard-only coverage or requires the kind on `draft->developing` as well; both are defensible, but it has to be a decision. The same registration then sources an optional `specRefs` index on every single-card result, shaped exactly like `artifactGates` beside it: id, title, description, path, and rolled-up freshness, **never the body**. A body reaches the model through `devflow_read_spec` on demand, and that read renders an explicit warning line whenever the document is not fresh — a read returning only prose would drop the one signal this seam exists to carry.

A scope that was never declared stays silent — a card that has not yet said what it touches is an ordinary card — and declared prefixes that reach nothing omit the index too, leaving that coverage gap to the census. But a registration that yields no readable scope — an unreadable file, no `## Scope` section, or no entry under it — puts one warning line on the single-card result saying the index is not being served: that card promised a declaration, and silence would read as "no documents".

### Revising and retiring

`replaces` is what lets the set shrink. Naming the written id revises in place; naming others merges a cluster and deletes them. The growth ceiling charges the **net** change, so folding three documents into one is never refused for being large — billing a merge as pure addition would refuse precisely the move that relieves the pressure. Every rejection settles before the first write, so a refused merge leaves the root byte-for-byte as it was; this is deliberately not crash atomicity across the several files a merge touches, since the replacement is written before anything is removed and an interrupted merge therefore leaves duplication rather than a gap.

On the way out, a `spec-delta` artifact makes the card triage what it produced: `reference` becomes a document here, `obligation` goes to a rule set that stays resident and is enforced by a check script. Mount it on **all three** terminal edges — a service class adds edges rather than replacing them, so a contract naming only `testing->done` lets precisely the cards that skipped review also skip triage. Like `spec-refs`, this is opt-in paperwork: a default composition already reacts to the staleness itself through the sentinel, and `spec-delta` is for deployments that want a per-card written triage on top.

### Reading the health of the set

`/devflow spec` reports it on the human plane: how many documents are fresh, which are stale or unevaluable **and which anchor failed**, then a coverage census placing every expected scope in one of three states — documented, waived by a named document, or no document — each measured over the count of files under it an anchor could point at. It is derived from `list()` plus `evaluate()` rather than a store method, and it is not a model-facing tool — a whole-set census is the opposite of the index-not-bodies discipline the card results follow. Expected coverage is discovered before it is configured: with no `specScopes` configured, the census asks the optional `devflowSpecWorkspace` service — the sentinel's workspace-layout resolver — for the invoking workspace's package layout and treats its scope ids as the expected set, saying so in the report. Configuring `specScopes` overrides that discovery whole rather than joining it — listing scopes is saying "ask about exactly these", which includes the right to leave a discovered package unasked. With neither source the report says the coverage question was not asked, which is not the same as saying there are no gaps.

The waived state is what a document's optional `waives` field buys: a deliberate decision that a scope needs no architecture document, carried by an ordinary document that had to say why and rest that reason on anchors — so the waiver falls into doubt on the day the document goes stale, and only `no document` is ever counted as a gap. No count in the census is a threshold. Whether a scope has enough documents is the judgement it hands back, the same line the structural contract draws when it declines to check whether each claim carries an anchor, and the file count is what makes that judgement possible rather than what makes it for you.

### Bootstrapping on the board

Cold-starting a large repository's document set takes several passes across several sessions, and a pass currently leaves nothing behind but its documents: the candidate list it judged — what it considered, what it rejected and why — is spoken in a turn and gone, and nothing reviews it. A deployment that wants that list kept and checked can put the run on the card board, and **needs no new mechanism to do it**: the artifact contract, the admission gate, and the completion policy already compose into the whole route, which is why what follows is a configuration sample rather than a package.

**A card carries a pass's work; it never carries coverage.** That is the boundary the shape is built around, and it is not a style preference. `/devflow spec` computes coverage from what is on disk and cannot drift; a board tracking the same question necessarily does, because `devflow_write_spec` is a complete commit point on its own and nobody has to touch a card for a document to land. Mirroring the census onto cards would also break this line's own rule that state is published at its commit point — the commit point of "this scope has a document" is the write, not a transition. So a parent card's completion criterion **cites** the census (it finishes when the census stops reporting these scopes with no document) rather than restating it, and the `bootstrap-pass` kind below deliberately has no `Remaining` section for anyone to fill in.

This adds no fourth place to read documents from. The census answers "what does the whole set look like" on the human plane; the `devflow-spec-map` pre-step index answers "which documents touch what this session is editing"; a card's `spec-refs` answers "which documents does this card's work touch". A `bootstrap-pass` registration answers none of those — it is not a read face at all, but the record of one pass's decisions, kept so a gate can judge them.

The shape is one parent card for the repository and one child card per uncovered scope, with the cross-cutting pass as the parent's own direct work. `dsh-devflow-parent-gate` already refuses a parent's `done` while any child is elsewhere, so nothing here re-states completion policy. The devflow half of such a profile:

```yaml
# The store, then the three policies this route needs, in waterfall order.
- name: '@zhchxiao123/dsh-devflow-filesystem'

# Layer 1 — mechanical: the pass's verdict list is registered and whole.
# `Verdicts` is a nonEmptySection because an empty verdict section is not a
# pass that judged nothing, it is a pass that did not answer; `Scopes` and
# `Candidates` are held to the same bar for the same reason. `Written` and
# `Waived` only have to exist: a pass where no candidate cleared the bar
# writes no document, and most passes waive nothing.
- name: '@zhchxiao123/dsh-devflow-artifact-gate'
  config:

      bootstrap-pass:
        frontmatter: [card]
        sections: [Written, Waived]
        nonEmptySections: [Scopes, Candidates, Verdicts]
    edges:
      # BOTH edges that leave `developing`. A service class adds edges and
      # removes none: `express` leaves through the standard

      # precisely the fastest cards out with no verdict list at all.
      'developing->reviewing': [bootstrap-pass]
      'developing->done': [bootstrap-pass]

# Layer 2 — admission: the three things a structure check cannot see. Both
# edges share one instruction on purpose; a checker that judged the
# emergency route more loosely would make the shortcut the way around the

    edges:
      'developing->reviewing': &bootstrap-check
        provider: claude
        inputs: [bootstrap-pass]
        prompt: |
          Judge this bootstrapping pass's verdict list. The structural check
          has already passed, so every section exists; you are checking
          whether what is written in them is honest. Read the documents named
          under `Written` with devflow_read_spec when you need to see their
          anchors. Judge exactly these three things, and veto naming the
          offending line if any of them fails.

          1. Every candidate has a verdict, and every rejection carries a
          reason about that candidate. A reason that would read the same
          under any other line — "not load-bearing", "the code already says
          this", "out of scope" with nothing specific to the claim — is a
          rejection with the reason left out, and the count of documents
          written is only reviewable when the rejections are real.

          2. Every claim under `Written` rests on an anchor kind that can
          falsify it. A behavioral claim — which methods an endpoint answers,
          what a failure path returns, an algorithm, a validation rule — must
          rest on `content-hash`. A `symbol` anchor watches only the name, so
          adding a handler turns the claim false while the anchor still
          reports fresh, and the document then states the opposite of the
          code with nothing left to report it. `symbol` is right only for a
          claim about what the code is called or how it is shaped, `churn`
          only where no parser reads the file. Veto naming the document, the
          anchor, and the claim the anchor fails to watch.

          3. Every scope under `Waived` is carried by a real document that
          names it in `waives`. Read that document: it has to say why the
          scope needs none and rest that reason on its own anchors. A scope
          listed as waived without such a document is an undocumented
          decision, not a waiver.

          `Scopes` is what this pass took, never what the repository has
          left. Coverage is the `/devflow spec` census's answer and its
          absence here is deliberate, so do not ask for a remaining-scope
          list.
      'developing->done': *bootstrap-check

# Layer 3 — completion: the repository card finishes after every scope card
# does. No config; the rule is the parent/child relation.
- name: '@zhchxiao123/dsh-devflow-parent-gate'
```

A registration the gates accept looks like this — the `Written` lines name the anchor kind, which is what makes criterion 2 judgeable from the artifact instead of from a re-read of the whole scope:

```md
---
card: 0002-scope-api-gateway
---

## Scopes

spring-petclinic-api-gateway

## Candidates

- The fallback endpoint answers POST only; a GET through the gateway gets 405.
- `default-filters` attaches a CircuitBreaker and a POST-only Retry to every route.
- A failed visits call degrades to an empty visit list rather than an error.
- The module is a Spring Boot application.

## Verdicts

- fallback method set — pass: a stranger reads the 405 as a routing defect and "fixes" it.
- default-filters — pass: the retry covers POST alone, and no single call site shows that.
- visits degradation — pass: the empty list is designed behaviour and reads as data loss.
- Spring Boot application — reject: the annotation on the class states it, so the claim is not non-obvious.

## Written

- `gateway-fallback-semantics` — claim: the fallback endpoint answers POST only — anchor: `content-hash` on `FallbackController`

## Waived

None.
```

Service class is a judgement the run makes per card, and the classes are what the two gated edges exist for: a bootstrap pass has no design round to skip, so `express` (`draft->developing`, then the standard exit through `reviewing`) is usually the honest class, and `emergency` (`draft->developing`, then `developing->done`) fits a scope whose whole answer is a waiver. Both still register the pass, because both gated edges carry the same contract. [`tests/spec-bootstrap-board-composition.spec.ts`](../tests/spec-bootstrap-board-composition.spec.ts) boots exactly this composition through the real Loader and drives an `express` scope card, an `emergency` scope card, and their `express` parent to `done`, including the anchor-mismatch veto and the emergency edge's mechanical veto.

None of this is on by default. The bundle ships `devflow-artifact-gate` and `devflow-agent-gate` disabled, and without the `kinds`/`edges` above a bootstrapping pass behaves exactly as it does with no board at all — the skill's procedure, the census as the completion criterion, and nothing registered anywhere. The [`devflow-spec-bootstrap` skill](../packages/devflow-guidance/README.md) carries the judgement of when the route is worth its paperwork: a repository whose gaps one pass can close should not pay for it.

## Iron rules

Documents are reference knowledge — worth knowing, read when relevant. The other kind is an **obligation**, where not following it is a mistake, and it takes the opposite injection strategy: [`dsh-devflow-iron-rules`](../packages/devflow-iron-rules/README.md) keeps rule bodies resident in every request rather than behind an index, because a rule the model never opened is one it never followed. Rules live under `.devflow/iron-rules/<id>/` as a `RULE.md` plus an optional `check.sh`, which runs when a turn that touched files is about to stop; failures come back as forced continuation until a retry ceiling hands the decision to a human.

Recording requires a stated triage — `script` or `judgement`, where `script` demands both a check and the paths it watches — because skipping the question "can a script decide this?" is how a rule set becomes all prose. The same write path is published as `ctx.devflowIronRules`, so a `spec-delta` obligation is forwarded as one call rather than a receipt someone typed. A deployment without that seam has nowhere to put an obligation and must say so.

<a id="devflow-commit-semantics"></a>

## Commit semantics of `.devflow`

Those three kinds of knowledge land in one directory alongside a fourth thing, and the four share no answer to "does this belong in git". What settles each one is **where its truth lives**, and getting it wrong fails silently in every case.

| Content | Files under `.devflow/` | In git | Written by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Card state | `tasks/**/journal.jsonl`, `card.md`, `artifacts/` | required | [`dsh-devflow-filesystem`](../packages/devflow-filesystem/README.md) |
| Repository knowledge | `spec/`, `iron-rules/`, `business/` | required | [`dsh-devflow-spec-tool`](../packages/devflow-spec-tool/README.md), [`dsh-devflow-iron-rules`](../packages/devflow-iron-rules/README.md), [`dsh-devflow-business`](../packages/devflow-business/README.md) |
| Deployment policy | `validation.json`, `midscene/settings.json`, `midscene/suites/` | expected | [`dsh-devflow-midscene`](../packages/devflow-midscene/README.md) |
| Process-transient state | `**/claim.json`, `**/commit.lock`, `midscene/operation.lock` | never | `dsh-devflow-filesystem`, `dsh-devflow-midscene` |

**Card state's truth is the journal.** `foldJournal` requires contiguous revisions, so a board that does not travel with its branch is not a board: a worktree taken from a repository that ignores `.devflow/tasks/` starts empty and renumbers new cards from `0001`. That is the precondition [the worktree fence](#worktree-development) protects, not a second rule stacked on it.

**Repository knowledge's truth is the file plus git** — the sentence the spec seam already rests on, and why a committed card and the documents it cites replay the same way in every checkout.

**A deployment policy's truth is the maintainer's decision.** `validation.json` exists so a required acceptance still blocks completion when no Midscene provider is mounted; a copy that never entered git withdraws that guarantee from every checkout but the one that wrote it.

**Process-transient state's truth is a live process**, which makes it the one kind that crosses a machine boundary as pure misinformation: a lease arriving on a branch assigns the card to a session that never existed here, and an inherited `commit.lock` fails every write on that card closed until someone deletes a lock no writer ever held. The general form answers any path this table does not name — **a file whose content means nothing on another machine does not belong in git.**

Every repository running devflow carries the same three lines, and they are the whole of what must never be committed:

```gitignore
# devflow process-transient state: a live process owns each of these, so a copy
# arriving on a branch describes a process that never ran here.
.devflow/**/claim.json
.devflow/**/commit.lock
.devflow/midscene/operation.lock
```

Ignoring `.devflow/` wholesale is how all four go wrong at once. [`tests/devflow-root-commit-contract.spec.ts`](../tests/devflow-root-commit-contract.spec.ts) pins both directions against a real repository: every transient path ignored, every card-state path tracked.

## Model guidance

That taxonomy has a third kind: **process judgment** — when work belongs on the board at all, which service class a card should carry, how a requirement decomposes, what makes an artifact worth a gate's yes, how to rework after a veto. Failing it is not breaking a rule but driving the workflow badly, so it takes the catalog strategy rather than residency: [`dsh-devflow-guidance`](../packages/devflow-guidance/README.md) ships it as the bundled `devflow-workflow` skill, one catalog line resident and the body loaded on demand, overridable by name through a lower-ranked same-layer provider. The body deliberately states no deployment's artifact contract — the artifact-gate preflight inside the tool results is the authority on that, at the moment it applies. A second bundled skill, `devflow-spec-authoring`, carries the authoring judgment for architecture documents — what deserves a document versus an iron rule, anchor choice, id scoping, revision through `replaces`, the response to a stale read — and registers only while the composition mounts `ctx.devflowSpec`, so no catalog ever advertises a skill teaching an absent capability. A third, `devflow-spec-bootstrap`, registers under the same condition and carries the cold-start procedure for a scope the census reports with no document — one scope at a time, claims established from the code rather than legacy documents, three documents read as one pass's pace rather than the scope's total with the census's file count as the way back to a large scope, and completion reached either by documents landing or by a waiver deciding the scope needs none.

The same package answers the question no tool description can — *does this workspace have a board worth reading first* — with the `devflow-board` runtime context: stage counts, the claimed cards, and a pointer at `devflow_create` and the skill, capped at 1024 bytes because awareness is not a board mirror and the real board is one `devflow_list` away. A pre-step listener re-reads the board each step (one failed readdir on a workspace without `.devflow/`, which therefore contributes nothing), and the harness diffs the rendered snapshot, so an unchanged board is never re-sent. Neither layer carries obligations: per-call protocol stays in the tool descriptions and enforcement stays with the gates, so a deployment that never loads the skill or suppresses runtime context loses guidance, never a guarantee.

## Worktree development

Several cards developed in one checkout share one branch, so a range-mode review of either card sees both cards' changes — the cross-contamination [`dsh-devflow-review-gate`](../packages/devflow-review-gate/README.md) names as its known limitation. [`dsh-devflow-worktree`](../packages/devflow-worktree/README.md) answers it with topology instead of a new state store: one card, one branch, one linked git worktree. Because `.devflow/` is committed and every consumer resolves its root from the session's own directory, a worktree is already a complete workspace — the branch carries the card, the card's workspace is the worktree, and gate commands, reviews, and checker subagents land there without any package changing how it resolves a directory.

The package contributes judgment and one fence. The bundled `devflow-worktree-runbook` skill carries the ceremony: attach a dispatch artifact (kind `worktree`, frontmatter `branch`/`base`/`worktree`) to the `ready` card, commit it, then create the branch and worktree — in that order, because a dispatch attached after branching writes the card on both sides of the fork. From then on only the card's own worktree writes it, until the merged pull request delivers code and journal together. The fence enforces exactly that rule on the transition waterfall: a dispatched card transitions only from its named worktree or from the repository's main working tree (derived per directory via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`), and every other checkout is vetoed with both directories named. A card without a dispatch artifact is untouched, so mounting the row changes nothing until a card is actually dispatched. The rule's teeth are structural: two checkouts appending one card's journal merge into a revision conflict `foldJournal` fails loudly on, so the fence is enforcing the precondition of the board's own durability model. The [worktree Agent Note](../.agents/notes/implemented/feature/2026-09-16-devflow-worktree-per-card.md) owns the decision.

### `ctx.devflow` — `DevflowStore` (abstract seam)

Abstract task-card store registered as `ctx.devflow` (one implementation per context; loading a second throws, cordis' standard duplicate-service behavior). Subclass, implement the abstract methods, and load the subclass as a plugin.

Implementations must honor these read-side semantics:

- Current state comes from journal replay (foldJournal); the card file's frontmatter is a projection. On disagreement the journal wins and the drift is warned, never silently adopted.
- A structurally invalid journal fails the read loudly, naming the file and line; a card is never silently skipped.

```ts cordis-catalog

 * that must reason over the whole board (a completion policy, a board
 * snapshot, a parent's progress) can trust the count.

 * the active set and not for the archive, which grows without bound. Reach
 * archived cards through {@link query} instead.

### `ctx.devflowArtifactStructures` — `ArtifactStructures` (value service)

Read-only kind-spec table published by `dsh-devflow-artifact-gate`, registered for the plugin's fiber lifetime and gone when it disposes. Optional service: read it with `ctx.get('devflowArtifactStructures')`, never the property proxy — a deployment without the gate simply has no specs to template against.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * The gate's configured kind specs, published read-only so a producer can
 * shape a deliverable to the same spec the gate will check. Optional
 * service: read it with `ctx.get('devflowArtifactStructures')`.
 */
devflowArtifactStructures: ArtifactStructures

/**
 * Value of the `devflowArtifactStructures` service: the configured specs, deep
 * frozen and normalized (empty lists dropped).
 */
type ArtifactStructures = { readonly [kind: string]: ArtifactKindStructure }

/**
 * Structural requirements of one artifact kind. Both lists are optional and an
 * empty list equals omission; a kind declared with neither is required only to
 * be registered. The lists stay mutable in type for the config validator's
 * sake; the published service value is deep frozen regardless.

   * Frontmatter fields the artifact must carry, each present with a value —

### `ctx.devflowArtifactContract` — `ArtifactContract` (value service)

Optional dynamic preflight published for the artifact gate's fiber lifetime. `inspectOutgoing(card)` returns configured legal outgoing edges with every required kind's immutable spec, newest registration, `missing | malformed | satisfied` status, and all defects. The transition listener consumes the same internal inspection, so reported defects and enforcement are identical.

```ts cordis-catalog
interface ArtifactContract {
  inspectOutgoing(card: DevCard): Promise<readonly ArtifactTransitionInspection[]>
}

interface ArtifactTransitionInspection {
  readonly from: CardLocation
  readonly to: CardLocation
  readonly requirements: readonly ArtifactRequirementInspection[]
}

interface ArtifactRequirementInspection {
  readonly kind: string
  readonly status: 'missing' | 'malformed' | 'satisfied'
  readonly spec: PublishedArtifactKindStructure
  readonly artifact?: Readonly<ArtifactRecord>
  readonly defects: readonly string[]
}
```

### `devflow/*` events

<a id="devflowcard-created--emit"></a>

#### `devflow/card-created` — emit

A new card entered the active set: its journal committed the first `created` entry. Dispatched once per creation, after the projection write.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * A new card entered the active set: its journal committed the first
 * `created` entry. Dispatched once per creation, after the projection
 * write.
 * @mode emit
 * @param card - the created card, at `draft` with revision 1.

```

<a id="devflowcard-archived--emit"></a>

#### `devflow/card-archived` — emit

A card left the active set for the archive. Dispatched once per archived card, so a cascade over a requirement's sub-requirements dispatches once for each. Not folded into `devflow/stage-changed`: archiving does not move the card, and a listener would have to re-derive which of the two happened.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * A card left the active set for the archive.
 * @mode emit
 * @param card - the card as of the committed `archived` entry.
 */
'devflow/card-archived'(card: DevCard): void
```

Source: [`packages/devflow/src/types.ts`](../../packages/devflow/src/types.ts)

<a id="devflowcard-restored--emit"></a>

#### `devflow/card-restored` — emit

An archived card returned to the active set at the stage it already had.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * An archived card returned to the active set at the stage it already had.
 * @mode emit
 * @param card - the card as of the committed `restored` entry.

```

<a id="devflowstage-changed--emit"></a>

#### `devflow/stage-changed` — emit

A card settled at a new location after a committed transition.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * A card settled at a new location after a committed transition.
 * @mode emit
 * @param card - the card after the move, `stageRevision` already advanced.
 * @param from - the location the card departed.
 */
'devflow/stage-changed'(card: DevCard, from: CardLocation): void
```

Source: [`packages/devflow/src/types.ts`](../../packages/devflow/src/types.ts)

<a id="devflowtransition--waterfall"></a>

#### `devflow/transition` — waterfall

Single-decision transition pipeline. The store dispatches this after the revision and edge checks and before the journal commit; a policy listener that owns the decision returns `{ allowed: false, reason }` without calling `next()`, while an observing listener must delegate.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**

 * revision and edge checks and before the journal commit; a policy
 * listener that owns the decision returns `{ allowed: false, reason }`
 * without calling `next()`, while an observing listener must delegate.
 * @param attempt - the resolved transition about to commit, including its departure location.
 * @param next - delegate to the remaining listeners, finally `{ allowed: true }`.
 * @mode waterfall
