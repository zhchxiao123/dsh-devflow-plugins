# Agent Note: devflow — stage executors receive model and workspace routing

Status: implemented

## Problem

The devflow driver creates synthetic parent agents only to anchor child lineage and workspace metadata. An in-process child inherits its workspace from the parent's session header and its provider/model route from the parent unless the start request supplies `agentOptions`. A parent without `cwd` and a dispatch without those options therefore create a child missing both runtime inputs. A deployment persona that references `{{model}}` or `{{cwd}}` then fails strict prompt assembly before the child can make a model request or call a tool, and the driver parks the card `blocked` after the child ends with `stopReason: 'error'`.

The deployment already owns a current provider/model pair through the published `ctx.agentDefaultModel` service. Each card also carries its resolved devflow state root, whose parent directory is the workspace represented by that board. Repeating model selection in driver configuration or using one process-wide workspace would discard those existing authorities.

## Decision

The driver requires `agentDefaultModel` alongside its agent, subagent, and devflow services. Immediately before each `ctx.subagents.start()` call, it reads `ctx.agentDefaultModel.currentSelection()` and copies the provider/model pair into the request's `agentOptions`. The child therefore has a complete model route before prompt assembly.

The driver owns one registered, never-prompted synthetic parent per card root. That parent's session `cwd` is the parent directory of the resolved devflow root, so in-process children inherit the workspace that contains their card. Parent registrations are effects owned by the driver fiber and disappear on disposal. Cards from different roots never share a workspace anchor.

Selection happens per dispatch rather than at driver activation. A later deployment-model change affects later stage executors without rebuilding the driver plugin or changing its stage configuration.

## Alternatives considered

- **Add provider and model fields to driver configuration.** This makes the driver another owner of deployment model selection and allows its value to diverge from the settings-backed default already used by ordinary Web agents. A dedicated executor-model option remains possible when a concrete deployment needs a route distinct from the default.
- **Put the route on the synthetic parent and rely on inheritance.** Inheritance would make children runnable, but it snapshots the route when the driver activates and makes an incidental lineage object the owner of request routing. Passing `agentOptions` states the child requirement at the dispatch boundary.
- **Use one synthetic parent with the process working directory.** One workspace would make the default root work while sending cards from other roots into the wrong filesystem scope. Per-root parents preserve the driver's existing multi-workspace contract.
- **Make the harness fabricate a default route for every routeless agent.** The harness deliberately preserves empty agent options and lets entry points declare model ownership. Changing that rule would affect every synthetic-agent consumer; the driver can satisfy the published child-start contract locally.
- **Remove `{{model}}` from the deployment persona.** That hides the missing route at one prompt section while the child still cannot issue a valid model request.

## Consequences

Driver activation waits for the default-model service, which the base harness bundle provides. Every accepted stage-executor request carries an explicit provider/model pair and a parent whose session declares the card workspace, so model- and workspace-aware persona assembly resolves before the child turn begins. The real-composition driver test records both provider-facing inputs, proves that a second root receives its own workspace, and proves that driver disposal unregisters its parents.
