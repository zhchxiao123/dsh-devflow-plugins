/**
 * Board-snapshot rendering: a pure function from one workspace's card facts
 * to the runtime-context text published before each model step.
 *
 * The snapshot is awareness, not a board mirror: it answers "there is a
 * board, this is in flight, new work starts as a card" and the real board is
 * one `devflow_list` away. That is why {@link SNAPSHOT_MAX_BYTES} is 1024
 * bytes — stage counts, a dozen claimed-card lines, and the guidance line fit
 * comfortably, while the harness resends the whole merged runtime-context
 * snapshot (sandbox, approvals, this) whenever ANY part of it changes, so
 * every byte here taxes every such change. Over the cap, claimed-card lines
 * are dropped from the end and the drop is announced in the output.
 *
 * Claimed cards render without a "claimed by you" qualifier: the rendered
 * text is cached per workspace root and served to every agent assembling in
 * that workspace, so attributing a lease to the reading session would be
 * invented, not read.
