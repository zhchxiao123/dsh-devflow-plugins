/**
 * Bundled skill providers — the judgment half of the devflow surfaces. The
 * devflow tools commit individual moves and the gates and stores enforce
 * per-call obligations; each skill owns the cross-tool judgment no single
 * tool description can. `devflow-workflow` carries the board process: entry
 * judgment, service-class selection, decomposition, artifact craft, rework
 * after a veto, and claim discipline. `devflow-spec-authoring` carries the
 * architecture-document judgment: what deserves a document, anchor choice,
 * scoping, revision, and the response to staleness. `devflow-spec-bootstrap`
 * carries the cold-start procedure for a scope the census reports uncovered:
 * reading order, what to look for, and the completion criterion. All register
 * at `BUNDLED_SKILL_RANK`, so a same-layer provider with a lower rank
 * overrides any of them by name.
