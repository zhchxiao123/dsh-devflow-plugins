/**
 * Browser-trust fence for devflow's own route, restating the rule the harness
 * applies to `/api`. The rule is restated rather than imported because its
 * implementation is package-internal to `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-connection`;
 * this plugin depends only on published surface, so a rule it cannot import it
 * repeats — and a divergence between the two is a defect in this file.
 *
 * Two confused-deputy paths are closed. DNS rebinding: a browser fills `Host`
 * from the name it believes it is talking to, so a rebound page carries the
 * attacker's authority even though the socket lands here — `Host` is the one
 * header rebinding cannot forge, and it binds every request, marked or not.
 * Cross-site requests: a browser labels the initiator relationship on every
 * fetch, and attaches an `Origin` that must be this authority.
 *
 * Network reachability and authentication stay out of scope: what the server
 * binds to is webserver config, and this is not an auth layer.
