 * The package's whole surface: one bundled skill teaching an agent to turn

 * `docs/agent/e2e-setup.md` plus `up`/`check`/`down` scripts — so no later
 * agent re-explores the repo to bring services up for end-to-end testing.
 * The judgment is entirely the skill's; this module only serves its body.
 *
 * The body is shipped verbatim as the author wrote it, in Chinese. That
 * differs from every other asset in this line and is deliberate — the text
 * is the contract, and translating it would be a rewrite, not a
 * translation. Do not "fix" the language.
 *
 * Registered at `BUNDLED_SKILL_RANK`, so a same-layer provider with a lower
 * rank overrides it by name.
