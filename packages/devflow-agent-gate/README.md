English | [中文](README.zh.md)

LLM admission policy on the [`devflow/transition`](../devflow/README.md) waterfall: a configured edge dispatches a **one-shot checker subagent** — independent of whatever produced the work — that reads the card and the newest registration of each configured input kind and answers with a structured verdict. An allow travels into the committed entry's `gate.checks`; a veto writes the full report to `reportDir` and rejects the move naming that file; any fault that keeps the checker from actually running **fails closed**: the move is vetoed and the card is parked `blocked`. The producer never certifies its own work, and a broken checker never waves a move through.

## Behavior

For an attempt on edge `from->to` with an `edges` entry, the gate reads the moving card, inlines the newest registration of each `inputs` kind (the record with the highest journal revision), and starts one checker on the configured subagent provider: a fresh session sharing no history with the producer, routed to the deployment's current default model, whose prompt is the configured instruction, the card title and body, each input under a `--- artifact <kind> (rev N) ---` separator, and a fixed contract requiring one fenced JSON verdict block — `{ "verdict": "allow" | "veto", "summary": "...", "findings": ["..."] }`. The last parsable block of the reply is the decision, so a checker may quote the contract without being misread.

- **Allow** — the gate delegates, and when the rest of the waterfall also admits the move, appends `{ by: { kind: 'agent' }, verdict: 'allowed', summary }` to the decision's `checks`, which the store records on the committed journal entry alongside whatever the downstream policies collected (a human `approvedBy`, other checks). A downstream veto passes through untouched.
- **Veto** — the move is rejected without delegating: the full report (summary, findings, the checked `kind:rev` list) is written to `reportDir/<card>-<from>-<to>-r<revision>.md` and the veto reason names that file. A veto is not a commit — no journal entry, same revision.
- **Fail closed** — the provider is not registered, the subagent runtime is not composed, the dispatch rejects, the checker overruns `checkTimeoutMs` or exits abnormally, the reply carries no parsable verdict, a registered input file cannot be read, or the veto report cannot be written: the move is vetoed with the fault in the reason, and the card is parked `blocked` (actor `command devflow-agent-gate`) so an unattended run stops instead of retrying into the same fault — the same posture as `dsh-devflow-gates` when no human approver is reachable. The parking move is queued behind the vetoed transition's per-card serialization, never awaited inside the waterfall; recovery returns the card to its stage and re-attempts the gate normally.

An edge with no entry delegates without touching the store. An input kind with no registration is skipped, not vetoed — requiring presence and structure is [`dsh-devflow-artifact-gate`](../devflow-artifact-gate/README.md)'s mechanical contract, composed ahead of this gate.

## Config

```yaml
- id: devflow-agent-gate
  name: '@zhchxiao123/dsh-devflow-agent-gate'
  config:
    edges:
      'designing->ready':
        provider: spawn
        inputs: [prd, design, implement]
        prompt: Check that the design covers every PRD acceptance criterion and the implementation list starts with its test cases.
    reportDir: .devflow-agent-gate-reports
    verdictCacheDir: .devflow-agent-gate-cache
    checkTimeoutMs: 600000
```

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `edges` | `{}` | Admission check per `from->to` edge: the subagent `provider` the checker starts on, the `inputs` artifact kinds inlined into its prompt (optional; unregistered kinds are skipped), and the `prompt` instruction it judges by. An edge with no entry is not checked. |
| `reportDir` | — (required) | Directory receiving every veto's full report. Required because the report is the rework input; a gate that could drop it would reject moves while hiding why. An unwritable report fails the check closed. |
| `verdictCacheDir` | unset | Directory of cached verdicts. Unset disables caching and every attempt dispatches a fresh checker. |
| `checkTimeoutMs` | `600000` | Milliseconds one checker may take from dispatch to verdict; overrunning fails closed. |

Misconfiguration fails the load, naming the config item: an edge key not of the form `<from>-><to>` with known location names, a blank `provider` or `prompt`, an input kind outside the seam's kind grammar (lowercase letters, digits, and dashes, starting alphanumeric), a blank `reportDir` or `verdictCacheDir`, or a non-positive `checkTimeoutMs`.

## The verdict cache

A verdict is cached under the key (edge, root, card, sorted input `kind:rev` pairs, instruction hash) — everything that determines what the checker saw, since a card body is immutable after creation and artifact registrations are immutable per revision. An identical retry reuses the record without dispatching: a cached allow admits the move with its journal check summary prefixed `[cached] `, a cached veto rejects pointing at the original report. Registering a new revision of any input changes the key and re-dispatches.

The cache is an optimization, never an authority. Each file stores its full key detail, so a hit requires field-by-field equality (insurance against a filename-hash collision) and a human can audit or delete one cached decision; a corrupt file is a warned miss, an unwritable cache only warns, and writes are atomic (temp + rename). Faults are never cached — only verdicts are.

## Model Experience

### Checker prompt

#### What the model sees

Each dispatched checker's user message is the configured `prompt` instruction, the line `You are gate-checking devflow card <id> on edge <from>-><to>.`, the card title and Markdown body, every configured input's newest content under its `--- artifact <kind> (rev N) ---` separator, and the fixed closing contract: judge only against the instruction, act as a read-only checker calling no devflow or file-writing tool, and end the reply with one fenced JSON verdict block.

#### Token effect

One full subagent request per cache miss, proportional to the card body plus **all** inlined input artifacts plus the fixed contract lines — on a design-review edge that is typically the PRD, the design, and the implementation plan in one prompt. Cache hits cost zero tokens; unconfigured edges add nothing to any request.

#### KV Cache effect

Independent: every checker is a fresh one-shot session sharing no prefix with the producer, the driver's children, or earlier checks — a re-dispatch after an input revision pays the full prompt again.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- **Verdict quality is the deployment's prompt responsibility.** This gate guarantees the checker runs, is independent, sees the declared inputs, and cannot fail open — not that its judgment is any good. A vague `prompt` buys vague vetoes.
- **Waterfall order is deployment load order.** Compose this gate after `dsh-devflow-artifact-gate` (so a missing artifact vetoes mechanically before a checker spends tokens) and before `dsh-devflow-gates` approvals (so a human is not asked about work an agent would reject). Nothing enforces that order; the composition's row order does.
- **The checker's tool face is only restricted when the provider supports it.** When the provider declares the start-time `toolFilter` capability, the gate denies the devflow mutation tools and the file write tools (intersected with what is actually registered, because the runtime rejects unknown names). A provider without the capability runs the checker with whatever tools the deployment gives children — the verdict contract instructs read-only conduct, but that is instruction, not enforcement; the same trade-off as the driver's "the child's toolset is the deployment's problem".
- **A gate that is not composed checks nothing.** Like every waterfall policy, the fence exists only while the plugin is loaded; a missing subagent runtime at check time fails closed, but a deployment that never loads this plugin has silently ungated edges.
- **A cached veto points at its original report.** Deleting reports while keeping the cache leaves the pointer dangling; delete the cache directory (or the one record) with them.
