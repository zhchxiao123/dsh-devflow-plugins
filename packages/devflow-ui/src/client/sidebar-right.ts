/**
 * The slice of the Harness right-Sidebar contract this plugin consumes.
 *
 * `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-sidebar-right` is published, but its tarball
 * declares no dependency beyond `@deepseek-ai/cordis` while its `.d.ts` imports
 * `dsh-client-ui-dockkit` and `dsh-client-ui-layout/client`, which reach on to
 * `dsh-brand`, `dsh-client-ui-theme`, `dsh-client-ui-settings`, and the host
 * package `dsh-host-webserver`. Consuming it means pinning that whole graph
 * here, and under `skipLibCheck` every member of it left unpinned degrades to
 * `any` with no diagnostic. The stable service and slot boundary is restated
 * instead. A divergence from the Harness package's client contract is a defect
 * in this copy.
 *
 * The restatement is narrower than the original on purpose: it declares what
 * the board reads and omits the rest. The original's other three seats
 * (`rightbar.session`, `sidebar.right.pane.tab.title`,
 * `sidebar.right.tab.menu.item`) and its `sidebarRight` copy namespace are
 * absent because nothing here registers into them; the per-member narrowings
 * are noted at each declaration.
