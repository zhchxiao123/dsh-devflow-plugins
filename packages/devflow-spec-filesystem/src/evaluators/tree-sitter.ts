/**
 * Shared web-tree-sitter runtime behind the wasm-parsed language evaluators.
 *
 * One parser per language, loaded lazily and cached for the process: the
 * grammar wasm is resolved out of its own npm package rather than a hardcoded
 * node_modules path, so the exact-pinned dependency that carries the bytes is
 * also the only thing that locates them. The pin matters because the grammar
 * version is part of the hash domain — bumping it is a deliberate migration
 * that stales every content-hash anchor of that language once (see types.ts).
 *
 * The token-stream serializer here is the language evaluators' normalization
 * core: leaf tokens kept verbatim (string contents included), comments
 * dropped, block boundaries marked where a language asks for them, and a
 * container's trailing comma dropped where it is formatter noise.
