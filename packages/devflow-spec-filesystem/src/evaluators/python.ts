/**
 * Python evaluator (`.py` / `.pyi`): top-level symbol lookup and body
 * normalization behind `symbol` / `content-hash` anchors.
 *
 * A top-level symbol is a module-level `def`, `class`, or single-name
 * assignment; a decorated definition matches by its inner name but hashes the
 * whole decorated statement, because changing a decorator changes behavior.
 * Lookup over a file that no longer parses cleanly is best-effort: statements
 * the parser still recognizes at the top level are found, and a declaration
 * swallowed by an ERROR node reports as undeclared — a symbol lost to a
 * half-written file has genuinely stopped being checkable, and `stale` is the
 * honest verdict.
 *
 * Decisions in the hash domain, recorded here because changing any of them
 * stales every Python content-hash anchor at once:
 * - Docstrings stay in the hash. They are runtime-observable through
 *   `__doc__`, and stripping them would put a "first statement of a block"
 *   position rule into the hash domain for less than it costs.
 * - Quote style is not normalized: `'x'` and `"x"` hash differently. The
 *   TypeScript evaluator does not normalize quotes either; a formatter's
 *   one-time quote unification stales each touched file once, accepted.
 * - black's formatting dimensions: line rewrapping and indent width are
 *   absorbed by the token stream, the magic trailing comma by the inert
 *   trailing-comma rule, and quote unification is the accepted hash move.
