# @zhchxiao123/dsh-devflow-fs-guard

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Devflow state protection on the `fs/*` intent waterfalls: any file-tool mutation (`write`, `edit`, `str_replace_editor`) whose target path contains a protected directory segment is denied in the tool executor with the structured `FS_SANDBOX_DENIED` before the `ctx.fs` provider runs, and the denial message points the model at the devflow tools. Code stays fully writable; the card journal, projections, and leases change only through [`ctx.devflow`](../devflow/README.md), whose store writes host-side and therefore keeps the transition executor — revision CAS, edge legality, rework reasons, the [gates](../devflow-gates/README.md) waterfall — the only write path over the card history. Reads pass through untouched: the model may always inspect the journal it cannot forge.

The plugin registers no service and injects none; it is the policy third of the devflow stack the same way [`dsh-fs-observation-policy`](../../fs/fs-observation-policy/README.md) is for observed state, deployed beside the gate configuration in the profile.

## Config

```yaml
- id: devflow-fs-guard
  name: '@zhchxiao123/dsh-devflow-fs-guard'
  config:
    directories: ['.devflow']
```

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `directories` | `['.devflow']` | Directory names whose subtrees the file tools must not mutate, matched against every path segment of a mutation target. Bare names only; an empty or ill-formed list fails the load (unload the plugin to guard nothing). |

## Model Experience

### Tool results

#### What the model sees

No schema or prompt changes. A denied mutation returns the file tool's error result carrying the guard's message — the target path, the protected directory list, and the instruction to use `devflow_transition`/`devflow_create` instead.

#### Token effect

None until a denial; a denial costs one short error result.

#### KV Cache effect

None; the package never assembles or sends provider requests.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- **A policy fence, not a kernel boundary** — shell writes are confined only by the composed kernel sandbox, whose workspace-write profile still includes the devflow root; carving the protected directories out of the shared `writableRoots` set would extend the fence to bash and is deferred with the sandbox work.
- **Name matching, not root matching** — protection keys on directory names anywhere in the target path, not on resolved devflow roots, so a code directory that happens to be named `.devflow` is also read-only to the file tools.
