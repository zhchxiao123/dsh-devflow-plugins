/**
 * Devflow state protection on the `fs/*` intent waterfalls: any file-tool
 * mutation whose target lies under a protected devflow state directory is
 * denied in the tool executor, before the `ctx.fs` provider runs. Code stays
 * fully writable; the card journal, projections, and leases change only
 * through the devflow tools, whose store writes host-side and therefore keeps
 * the transition executor (revision CAS, edge legality, gates) the only write
 * path. The protected directory names are deployment configuration, delivered
 * beside the gate configuration in the profile.
 *
 * This is a policy fence over the tool plane, not a kernel boundary — the
 * same stance as the sandboxed filesystem backend. Shell writes are confined
 * only by the composed kernel sandbox, whose workspace-write profile still
 * includes the devflow root.
