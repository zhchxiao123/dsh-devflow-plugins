/**
 * Release preflight: pack every package and inspect the tarballs, not the
 * source tree. Each check exists because it is a way this line has actually
 * broken or would break a consumer, and none of them is visible from the
 * working directory:
 *
 * - a manifest pointing at a file the build did not produce publishes an empty
 *   shell that resolves to nothing (this happened: `main` was `lib/index.js`
 *   while only `lib/types/` was ever written);
 * - a `workspace:` range surviving into a tarball is unresolvable for everyone
 *   but us;
 * - `devflow-ui` without `lib/client.js` is not a degraded install but a
 *   refused boot, because the harness treats a `dsh.client` declaration with no
 *   bundle as fatal;
 * - versions that drift apart break the `^` ranges the packages use on each
 *   other, so they move together or not at all;
 * - a name already on npm at this version cannot be republished.
 *
 * Run it before `pnpm publish -r`; `pnpm run release` does.
 *
 * `--no-registry` drops the last check and keeps every other one. That check
 * asks whether this version is already on npm, which is only answerable about
 * a version being released — on a pull request the answer is "not yet" for
 * every commit, and making the whole run advisory to accommodate it is what
 * let the tarball checks stop blocking. CI runs the flagged form so they
 * block; the release runs the full one.
