// END-TO-END proof of the worktree dispatch ceremony: two real Loader
// compositions over one real git repository and one real linked worktree walk
// a card through the whole runbook — attach the dispatch artifact, commit it,
// branch, take and drive the card from inside the worktree, then merge the
// branch back into a main checkout that moved on meanwhile.
//
// The assertion the rest of the file exists for is that the merged journal
// still folds. Worktree-per-card rests entirely on "the branch carries the
// card, and the merge delivers it": if `foldJournal` could not replay the
// merged file, the flow would be destroying cards rather than isolating them,
// and no amount of fence would repair it. A second case pins the limitation
// the runbook states only in prose — a card minted inside the worktree
// collides with one minted on the main board, and nothing stops it.
//
// The composition here is this test's own minimal one. It deliberately does
// not read `examples/full-pipeline/cordis.patch.yml`: the example answers to a
// person copying it into a profile and is edited for readability, while this
// shape is edited for the smallest thing that can decide the question.
