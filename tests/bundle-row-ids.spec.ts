// A package is mounted by `devflow-bundle` XOR it ships its own

// algorithm rather than by reading the rule off a document.
//
// The failure it prevents is total, not partial. `dsh plugin add` appends
// every dependency that declares `dsh.bundle` to the profile's
// `dsh.profile.bundles`, and `applyEntryPatches` appends each layer's `insert`
// rows with no deduplication by id. A profile holding the bundle and a package
// that also patches itself therefore composes two rows of one id, and the
// Loader refuses the whole composition with `duplicate loader entry id` —
// a profile that no longer boots, from two installs that each worked alone.
//
// Nothing else in this repository composes more than one bundle layer, which
// is why the rule held for four packages by accident and broke the moment one
// of them was adopted.
